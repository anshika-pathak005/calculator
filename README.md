# 🧮 Calculator  

A simple and responsive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial, Developed entirely by me , I also added small improvements like a backspace feature and better operator handling.  

## 🔍 Overview  

This project was created for practice to understand how JavaScript can interact with HTML elements in real-time.  

It performs basic arithmetic operations and features a clean, minimal UI styled with CSS Grid.  

## ✨ Features  

- ➕ Basic arithmetic operations — Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- 🧹 Clear display (C) — Instantly clears all input  
- ⬅️ Backspace (←) — Removes the last entered character  
- 🔢 Decimal input support — Allows floating-point numbers  
- 📱 Responsive design — Buttons neatly arranged using CSS Grid  
- ⚠️ Error handling — Displays "Error" if input is invalid  

## 📂 Project Structure
